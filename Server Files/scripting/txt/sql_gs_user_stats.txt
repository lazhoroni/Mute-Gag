-- Rename table gs_user_stats to gs_user_stats_temp.
-- Create new gs_user_stats table that removes the season_id field.
-- Move all season_id=0 rows from gs_user_stats_global to gs_user_stats for server_id=0.
-- Move all season_id=0 && server_id>0 rows from gs_user_stats_temp to gs_user_stats for server_id>0.
-- Remove tables gs_user_stats_temp and gs_user_stats_global.

-- Repopulate table gs_user_stats_ranks every map change or 10 minutes.
 + user_id 0 and server_id = x will store the last time this table was updated under time_played column.
